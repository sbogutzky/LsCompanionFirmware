## What is the LsCompanionFirmware?

The LS Companion firmware is developed for a ESP32 microcontroller e.g. [Waveshare NodeMCU-32S ESP32 Development Board](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07TXNK6P1/ref=cm_sw_em_r_mt_dp_U_DbcMEbPJSWKTA). It uses an ultrasonic wave sensor [HC-SR04](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/15569) and determines the height of a height-adjustable table. It transmits the table height via BLE to a connected client.
